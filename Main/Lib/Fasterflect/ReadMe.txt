Fasterflect is an open source library that is used in Zenject to speed up its use of reflection and take advantage of its helper methods

You can find the project page here: http://fasterflect.codeplex.com/
It is apache license

Note however that the DLL included here is not a straight build from that site - I had to change a few things to make it compatible with Unity.  I have included the source code with my modifications (FasterflectSourceCode.zip)
